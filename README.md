# Predicting-the-Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains code for a machine learning project to predict the sale price of bulldozers. The project is based on the Blue Book for Bulldozers dataset from Kaggle.

## Features
The project includes the following features:

* Data cleaning and pre-processing
* Exploratory data analysis
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model selection and tuning
* Evaluation of model performance
## Benefits
By predicting the sale price of bulldozers, this project can have several potential benefits, such as:

Improved pricing accuracy and transparency for buyers and sellers
Increased efficiency and productivity in the construction and mining industries
Reduced costs and resource utilization for equipment dealers and rental companies
## Requirements
The project requires the following software and packages to run:

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
## Usage
To run the project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file in a Python environment with the required packages installed. The notebook includes step-by-step instructions for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection and engineering, model selection and tuning, and evaluation of model performance.

## Credits
The project was developed by Hafiz Muahammad Usama Saleem as part of a machine learning course. The Blue Book for Bulldozers dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
